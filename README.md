# atlassian-vs-plugins
A set of plugins to provide seamless integration with Atlassian products.
The goal is to provide a native Visual Studio interface which minimizes 
context switching between Visual Studio and the browser. 

A plugin for Jira/Jira Software will be the first plugin to be implemented.

Once the plugin for Jira/Jira Software is in a suitable release state Bitbucket may be added to allow seamless cloning from within Visual Studio.

Jira Server is the initial integration target however Jira Cloud may be added in the future.
